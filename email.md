# Email Template Writing Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you create effective email templates for your school outreach campaigns using the Maximally Outreach Dashboard. Well-crafted templates can significantly improve your response rates and engagement.

## Template Structure

### 1. Template Name
- Choose a descriptive name that indicates the purpose (e.g., "Introduction Template", "Follow-up Template")
- Keep it short but clear for easy identification in the dashboard
- Examples: "Product Demo Template", "Case Study Template", "Urgent Opportunity Template"

### 2. Subject Line Best Practices
- Keep it under 50 characters for better mobile display
- Make it specific and relevant to the recipient
- Use action words when appropriate
- Always include the `{{school_name}}` placeholder for personalization

**Good Subject Examples:**
```
Partnership Opportunity with {{school_name}}
Free Demo for {{school_name}} - Educational Technology
Following up on our conversation - {{school_name}}
```

**Avoid:**
- Generic subjects like "Hello" or "Quick Question"
- ALL CAPS text
- Excessive punctuation (!!!)
- Spam trigger words like "FREE!!!" or "URGENT!!!"

## Personalization Placeholders

Use these placeholders to make your emails personalized and relevant:

- `{{school_name}}` - The name of the school
- `{{contact_person}}` - The recipient's name
- `{{email}}` - The recipient's email address
- `{{city}}` - The city where the school is located

**Example Usage:**
```
Dear {{contact_person}},

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to {{school_name}} 
in {{city}} to discuss how we can support your educational goals.
```

## Email Content Structure

### Opening (First Paragraph)
- **Personal greeting**: Always address the contact person by name
- **Brief introduction**: Who you are and your company
- **Context**: Why you're reaching out specifically to their school

### Body (2-3 Paragraphs)
- **Value proposition**: What you offer and how it benefits them
- **Social proof**: Mention other schools' success stories when relevant
- **Specific benefits**: Tailor to educational outcomes

### Closing
